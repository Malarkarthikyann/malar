You are collecting personal information from other sources if you are collecting personal information about your users from sources other than the user themselves. For example, you may collect information from the internet (publicly available information, government records, social media, etc.) or from data sources (data brokers, email lists, third-party data scraping tools, industry reports, etc.).
